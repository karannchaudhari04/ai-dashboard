✅ Task A: AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard
Evaluation Based on the Requirements

✅ 1. Speed & AI Usage
You're using ChatGPT to build the full-stack dashboard efficiently.

✅ You can include an “AI Usage Report” in the README to document tools/prompts used.
➤ TODO: Add a short AI Usage Report section to your README like:

Edit
## 🧠 AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT: For code generation, UI structure, prompt-based design decisions
- GitHub Copilot: For auto-completions during coding (optional)
✅ 2. Beautiful UI Design
You’re using Tailwind CSS, responsive layout, Chart.js, and an elegant layout system.

Sidebar, Dashboard, Charts – all designed nicely.

✅ Mobile responsiveness is in progress. Fixing the global user role on mobile will complete this.

✅ 3. Component Reusability
You have a modular structure with:

components/Charts/Chart1.jsx

components/Layout/Layout.jsx

✅ Good reusability already.

✅ Bonus if you abstract repetitive chart containers into reusable components (optional improvement).

✅ 4. Problem-Solving
You've already implemented:

JWT Auth with protected routes

Admin/User roles

Secure backend APIs

Axios setup with 401 auto-logout

✅ Excellent problem-solving shown in fixing deployment + route issues.

✅ 5. Clean GitHub + Deployment
✅ Code is modular and well-structured.

✅ Frontend should be deployed on Vercel.

✅ Backend on Render/Railway/Fly.io/Cyclic.

🛠️ Missing / To-Do Items Before Submission
